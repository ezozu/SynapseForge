# SynapseForge: A Python Library for Modular Neural Network Construction

SynapseForge is a Python library designed to streamline the creation and manipulation of neural network architectures. Its core purpose is to provide a flexible and intuitive framework for building complex neural networks through modular components. Instead of hardcoding entire models, SynapseForge encourages developers to define individual layers, activation functions, and loss functions as reusable building blocks, which can then be easily assembled into custom architectures. This approach promotes code reusability, simplifies debugging, and facilitates experimentation with different network configurations.

The library aims to address the challenges associated with building and modifying neural networks in traditional deep learning frameworks. By offering a high level of abstraction, SynapseForge allows researchers and engineers to focus on the architectural design rather than the low-level implementation details. This is achieved through a declarative approach where users define the network's structure using Python code, which SynapseForge then translates into the underlying computation graph. Furthermore, the modular design makes it easier to swap out individual components, such as activation functions or optimizers, to evaluate their impact on the overall network performance. This is a crucial capability for rapid prototyping and experimentation in machine learning.

SynapseForge differentiates itself through its focus on modularity and extensibility. It provides a comprehensive set of built-in layers, activation functions, and loss functions, but also allows users to easily define their own custom components. This is accomplished through a well-defined API that simplifies the process of creating new layers and integrating them seamlessly into the existing framework. The library also provides utilities for visualizing network architectures and monitoring training progress, further enhancing the development workflow. SynapseForge is designed to be a valuable tool for both experienced deep learning practitioners and those new to the field, providing a gentle learning curve while offering the power and flexibility required for advanced research.

## Key Features

*   **Modular Layer Definition:** Define layers as independent, reusable components. Each layer implements a `forward()` and `backward()` method for defining the layer's operation and gradient computation, respectively. Example:
    

*   **Dynamic Network Assembly:** Construct networks by connecting layers in a flexible, graph-based manner. This enables complex architectures such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to be easily built.

*   **Automatic Differentiation:** The library automatically computes gradients for all layers, simplifying the training process. Gradients are calculated using backpropagation, leveraging the `forward()` and `backward()` methods defined for each layer.

*   **Custom Activation Function Support:** Define and integrate custom activation functions seamlessly. Simply implement a `forward()` and `backward()` method for the activation function.

*   **Optimizers:** Offers a range of optimization algorithms, including Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, and RMSprop. Each optimizer class updates the weights and biases of the network layers based on the calculated gradients.

*   **Loss Function Abstraction:** Provides a selection of common loss functions such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Cross-Entropy, along with the ability to define custom loss functions. Similar to layers and activation functions, custom loss functions require `forward()` (calculating the loss) and `backward()` (calculating the gradient of the loss) methods.

*   **Serialization and Deserialization:** Save and load network architectures and trained weights for later use. This feature is crucial for deploying trained models and resuming training from a checkpoint.

## Technology Stack

*   **Python 3.7+:** The core programming language for the library.
*   **NumPy:** Used for efficient numerical computation and array manipulation. Essential for handling tensors and performing linear algebra operations within the neural network.
*   **(Optional) Matplotlib:** For visualizing network architectures and training progress (loss curves, accuracy plots).
*   **(Optional) SciPy:** May be used for specific activation functions or loss functions requiring advanced mathematical operations.

## Configuration

SynapseForge primarily relies on in-code configuration. However, certain aspects can be influenced through environment variables:

*   `SYNAPSEFORGE_SEED`: Sets the random seed for NumPy, ensuring reproducibility. If not set, a system-generated seed will be used.  Example: `export SYNAPSEFORGE_SEED=42`
*   `SYNAPSEFORGE_DEVICE`: Determines the computation device (CPU or GPU). Currently, only CPU is fully supported. Setting it to `GPU` may enable preliminary GPU support in future versions. Example: `export SYNAPSEFORGE_DEVICE=CPU`

## Usage
